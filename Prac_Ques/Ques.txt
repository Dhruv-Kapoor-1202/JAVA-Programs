Array
1d Array Programs:
- Getting and Printing 1d array.
- Print the largest and smallest no into list
- Print sum of all the nos
- Sort the array into ascending and descending order
- To check whether the given no is present into list or not.
- Print the Sum of factorials of all the nos.
- Print all the prime nos into the given 1d array.
- Soft first half array into ascending order and second half array into descending
order.
- To remove the dulpilcate elements into the 1d array.
===========================================================
1d Arrays Programs:
=================
- Write a java program to insert the element into specific position into the given 1d Array.
- To check whether the sum of all the prime nos into 1d array is even or odd.
- To check whether the sum of all the ascii values of given 1d array of chars is palindrome or
not.
